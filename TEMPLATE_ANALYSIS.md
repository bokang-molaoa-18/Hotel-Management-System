- Added a "Testing" column to streamline QA processes.
- Introduced a "Blocked" column for tasks stalled due to dependencies.
- Linked GitHub Issues for real-time tracking of user stories and tasks.
- Used labels (`bug`, `feature`) for categorization and prioritization.

## Justification for Choosing Kanban Board

The **Kanban** template is the best fit for my project because:  
- It was the requirement for Assignment 7: GitHub Project Templates and Kanban Board Implementation
  
**Objective**
- Analyze GitHubâ€™s project templates.
- Select and justify the most suitable template for your system, and create a custom Kanban board to manage Agile workflows.

**Other justifications:**
- It automatically moves tasks across columns, reducing manual work.
- It supports sprint tracking, which aligns with Agile principles.
- It integrates well with GitHub Issues, making it easier to manage linked tasks.
- Its structure (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done) provides a clear workflow for our development process.
- The automation features will help our team focus on development rather than project management overhead.
- It offers flexibility to add custom columns (e.g., Testing, Blocked) to fit our specific workflow needs.
