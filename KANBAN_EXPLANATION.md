# Kanban Board Explanation  

## What is a Kanban Board?  
A Kanban board is a **visual project management tool** used to organize tasks and workflows stages (e.g., To Do, Blocked, Testing, In Progress, and Done). It ensures **real-time task visibility and efficient work prioritization**. It consists of columns that represent different stages of progress (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done") and cards that represent individual tasks or work items. 
These cards are moved across columns as tasks progress through the workflow, providing a clear overview of the team's work status.

## How Does a Kanban Board Help Agile Workflows?  

### Kanban boards enhance Agile workflows by:

- Visualizing Work: They provide real-time visibility into task statuses, helping teams identify bottlenecks and streamline processes.
- Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP): By restricting the number of tasks in each column, Kanban boards prevent overload and maintain team focus.
- Supporting Continuous Delivery: Tasks can be completed incrementally, ensuring adaptability and faster delivery cycles.
- Facilitating Collaboration: Teams can assign tasks, track ownership, and prioritize work collaboratively.

- Tasks **move through columns** representing different workflow stages.  
- Issues are **linked to the board and assigned labels** for organization.  
- **WIP limits prevent overloading developers**.

## How Does My Kanban Board Work?

### My Kanban board includes the following custom columns:

- Backlog: Tasks the team have to do.
- To Do: Tasks awaiting action.
- In Progress: Tasks currently being worked on.
- Testing: Tasks undergoing quality assurance checks.
- Blocked: Tasks are stalled due to dependencies or issues.
- Done: Completed tasks.

Cards are linked to GitHub Issues, labeled (e.g., bug, feature), and assigned to team members using @mentions and assign feature in the assign percepective. 
Automation moves tasks across columns based on updates (e.g., labels like done trigger movement to "Testing").

## How Do WIP Limits Help?

**Work-in-progress (WIP)** limits restrict the number of tasks allowed in each column at any given time.

**This helps by:**
- Preventing Bottlenecks: Ensures no single stage becomes overloaded, maintaining smooth workflow progression.
- Improving Focus: Encourages team members to concentrate on fewer tasks, increasing efficiency and quality.
- Enhancing Productivity: Reduces multitasking and context-switching, enabling faster task completion.

By implementing WIP limits on my Kanban board (e.g., 3 tasks per column), I ensure balanced workloads and avoid delays caused by overloading any stage of the workflow.

## Agile Benefits  
- Encourages **continuous integration and delivery**.  
- Helps **identify bottlenecks** (e.g., tasks stuck in "Blocked").  
- Ensures **smooth collaboration** between development and testing teams.
