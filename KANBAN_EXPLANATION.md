# Kanban Board Explanation  

## What is a Kanban Board?  
A Kanban board is a **visual project management tool** that tracks tasks across workflow stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). It ensures **real-time task visibility and efficient work prioritization**.

## How Our Kanban Board Works  
- Tasks **move through columns** representing different workflow stages.  
- Issues are **linked to the board and assigned labels** for organization.  
- **WIP limits prevent overloading developers**.  

## Agile Benefits  
- Encourages **continuous integration and delivery**.  
- Helps **identify bottlenecks** (e.g., tasks stuck in "Blocked").  
- Ensures **smooth collaboration** between development and testing teams.
