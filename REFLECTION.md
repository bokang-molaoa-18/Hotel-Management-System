**Challenges Faced in Balancing Stakeholder Needs**

1. Conflicting Priorities:
   - Guests prioritize ease of use and quick responses, while management focuses on operational efficiency and reporting capabilities.
   - Balancing these needs required prioritizing features that benefit both groups (e.g., real-time updates).

2. Technical Constraints:
   - Integrating third-party booking platforms posed challenges due to varying APIs and data formats.
   - Ensuring seamless integration required additional development time and testing.

3. Security vs Usability:
   - Implementing robust security measures (e.g., encryption) sometimes conflicted with usability goals (e.g., quick access).
   - Compromises were made by streamlining authentication processes while maintaining security standards.
     
4. Scalability Concerns:
   - Designing a scalable architecture that supports peak traffic without over-engineering was challenging.
   - Load testing helped identify bottlenecks early in development.
     
By addressing these challenges iteratively using Agile methodology, we ensured that stakeholder needs were met without compromising on quality or performance.
This document provides a comprehensive overview of stakeholder concerns, functional/non-functional requirements, 
and a reflection on challenges faced during requirements elicitation for the Hotel Management System project.
