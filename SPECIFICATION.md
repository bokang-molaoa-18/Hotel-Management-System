# Hotel Management System
## Introduction

### Project Title
Hotel Management System

### Domain
The domain of this project is the hospitality industry, specifically focusing on hotel operations. This system is designed to manage and streamline various aspects of hotel management, including reservations, customer service, housekeeping, and back-office tasks.

### Problem Statement
