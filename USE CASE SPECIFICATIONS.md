Key Design Notes:
Traceability: Each use case maps to 2-3 stakeholder concerns from Assignment 4 (e.g., Sync Bookings â†’ ThirdPartyPlatform's sync accuracy).

Error Handling: Alternative flows address critical failure points identified in stakeholder pain points (overbooking, payment failures).

Atomicity: Postconditions ensure system state consistency (e.g., inventory always matches reservations).

This specification format provides developers with executable requirements while giving testers clear validation criteria. The alternative flows directly address edge cases reported by stakeholders during requirement gathering.
